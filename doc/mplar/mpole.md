# Permanent Multipole (Up to Quadrupole) and Polarization Interactions
This file documented the pairwise quardupole interactions between atoms `i` and
`k`. Sometimes atoms `i` and `k` were referred to as atoms 1 and 2,
respectively.


## Rotation Matrix
Rotation matrix $R$ maps a vector (1D tensor) $\bm{x}$ from frame a to b,
$R\bm{x}_a = \bm{x}_b$. To preserve the dot product of any two vectors $\bm{x}$
and $\bm{y}$ in either frame, $\bm{x}_b^T \bm{y}_b = \bm{x}_a^T \bm{y}_a$, the
rotation matrix must be orthogonal, i.e., $R^T R = I$.

Rotating a 2D tensor (matrix) $Q_a$ from frame a to b, we have $Q_b$, and the
quadratic form must be preserved in both frames.
From $\bm{x}_b^T Q_b \bm{y}_b = \bm{x}_a^T Q_a \bm{y}_a$, we get

$$
Q_b = R Q_a R^T.
$$

Rotation matrix does not change the trace of matrix $Q$.
