/// \def TINKER_DETERMINISTIC_FORCE
/// Logical macro for the underlying type of energy gradients.
///    - If \c true, always uses fixed-point arithmetic to accumulate energy
///    gradients, regardless of the underlying type of each individual component.
///    - If \c false, use type \c real, which can either be \c float or \c double
///    based on the precision macro.
///
/// \see TINKER_DOUBLE_PRECISION
/// \see TINKER_MIXED_PRECISION
/// \see TINKER_SINGLE_PRECISION
///
/// In general, evaluating energy, forces, etc. twice, we don't expect to get
/// two identical answers, but we may not care as much because the difference
/// is usually negligible.
/// [See [Why is cos(x) !=
/// cos(y)?](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/newbie#floating-point-arith2)]
/// Whereas in MD, two simulations with the same initial configurations can
/// easily diverge due to the accumulated difference. If, for whatever reason,
/// you are willing to elongate the process of the inevitable divergence at the
/// cost of slightly slower simulation speed, a more "deterministic" force (using
/// fixed-point arithmetic) can help.
///
/// To accumulate floating-point values via fixed-point arithmetic, we first
/// scale the values by a large integer then sum only the integer part.
/// \code{.cpp}
/// // fixed sum = 0;
/// // FLT is float or double
/// FLT val2 = val * 0x100000000ull;
/// sum += (fixed)((long long)val2);
/// \endcode
/// To get the floating-point sum, we have to cast the integer sum back to
/// floating-point number, then divide it by the same large integer.
/// \code{.cpp}
/// FLT val2 = (FLT)((long long)sum);
/// FLT answer = val2 / 0x100000000ull;
/// \endcode
