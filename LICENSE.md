TINKER is a modular program package for molecular mechanics-based potential energy
calculations, geometry optimization, molecular dynamics simulation, free energy calculations,
distance geometry and structural analysis. The TINKER license covers the codes comprising the
Tinker suite: Tinker 8, Tinker 9 and Tinker-HP.
1. On behalf of the Tinker developer community, an informal consortium of researchers also
known as the Tinker Core Development Consortium ("TCDC") formed by Washington University
in Saint Louis (MO, USA), The University of Texas at Austin (TX, USA) and Sorbonne Université
(Paris, France) (collectively, TCDC-Members, individually TCDC-Member), the TCDC-Members
hereby grant to the Licensee (as identified in the signature block below) a non-exclusive, nonsublicensable, non-transferable, revocable, non-commercial license to use the object and source
code versions of the software known as “Tinker Software” (the "Software"), for internal
academic purposes only, including the right and license to incorporate improvements to the
Software, for a period of five (5) years subject to the terms and conditions below. All rights, title,
interest and copyright to the Software, to all portions thereof, and to any associated documentation
shall at all times remain the property of WU, UT Austin and Sorbonne.
2. A member of the TCDC will provide access to the Software to the Licensee, which may
install the Software on a local network controlled by the Licensee's responsible official and for the
use by the Licensee in accordance with this Agreement. The Software may be used beyond a local
network or on a supercomputing center only if indicated by the Licensee in the Research Purpose
section below. The Licensee may not sublicense the use of the Software, or make it available to
third parties, without the prior written consent of at least one TCDC-Member.
3. The Licensee accepts the Software "as is” and understands that it is experimental in nature.
The TCDC and TCDC-Members disclaim any and all representations and warranties, expressed or
implied, or statutory, of any kind or nature with respect to the Software, including without
limitation any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement
of any third-party patent, copyright, or any third-party right. The TCDC and all TCDC-Members,
their trustees, faculty, staff, students and agents, shall not be liable to Licensee, its successors,
assigns, contractors or sublicensees or any third party in any event for any damages or claims,
whether direct or indirect, special, consequential or incidental, arising from the use of the
Software.
4. Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TCDC and TCDC-Members, their
personnel, affiliates, and each of their respective trustees, faculty, staff, employees, students,
directors, officers, agents, successors and assigns (altogether the “TCDC Indemnitees”) from, for
and against any and all judgments, settlements, losses, expenses, damages and/or liabilities and any
and all court costs, attorneys’ fees, and expert witness fees and expenses that a TCDC Indemnitee
may incur from any and all allegations, claims, suits, actions or proceedings (the “Claims”) arising
out of, relating to, or incidental to Licensee’s breach of this Agreement or its use, development, modification, or other exploitation of Software, whether by or through Licensee, and including all
Claims for infringement, injury to business, personal injury, and product liability. The obligations
set forth in this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement, shall continue even after
assignment of rights and responsibilities, and shall not be limited by any provision of this
Agreement outside this Section.
5. The Licensee may create computer programs that incorporate or modify the Software or
resemble its structure, sequence or organization and may install and use such modified programs
on computers for which use of the Software is authorized as described in Section 2. The Licensee
may distribute binaries of the modified Software over the public community Tinker web site
(www.tinkertools.org). Licensee grants to the TCDC and each TCDC-Member a non-exclusive
license, with right to sub-license, to any and all source code that is delivered to the TCDC for
possible inclusion in further releases of the Software.
6. The Licensee agrees, in perpetuity, not to disclose the Software to any third party and to
use it only for the purposes of this Agreement, unless the TCDC gives prior written consent. In
protecting the Software, the Licensee must use at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its
own computer programs and other confidential information.
7. The user agrees that any reports or published results obtained with the Software will
acknowledge its use by the appropriate citation. Considering the use of Tinker 8, any published
work which utilizes Tinker shall give appropriate acknowledgement to the Tinker 8 developer
community's contribution by including the following main reference:
“TINKER 8: A Modular Software Package for Molecular Design and Simulation. Joshua A.
Rackers, Marie L. Laury, Chao Lu, Zhi Wang, Louis Lagardère, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pengyu

10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00529”
Considering the use of the specific Tinker-HP code, included in the Tinker distribution, any
published work which utilizes Tinker-HP shall give, in addition to the main Tinker reference,
appropriate acknowledgement to the Tinker-HP developer community's contribution by including
the following reference:
“Tinker-HP: A Massively Parallel Molecular Dynamics Package for Multiscale Simulations

8. This license may be terminated upon twenty days’ notice for any breach of this Agreement,
provided that that breach has not been corrected prior to the expiry of such notice.
9. Commercial use of the Software, or derivative works based thereon, REQUIRES A
COMMERCIAL LICENSE. Should Licensee wish to make commercial use of the Software,
Licensee will contact the agency listed below which holds exclusive rights to negotiate an
appropriate commercial license. Commercial Purposes include any sale, lease, license, or other
transfer of the Software in its entirety or in part, to another entity. Commercial Purposes also
includes, without limitation, uses of the Software by any entity, including Licensee, to perform any 
service for sale or contract research, to produce or manufacture products for sale.
